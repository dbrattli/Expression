# Welcome to Expression

Expression aims to be a solid, type-safe, pragmatic, and high performance
library for frictionless and practical functional programming in Python 3.11+.

By pragmatic, we mean that the goal of the library is to use simple abstractions
to enable you to do practical and productive functional programming in Python
(instead of being a [Monad tutorial](https://github.com/dbrattli/OSlash)).

Python is a multi-paradigm programming language that also supports functional
programming constructs such as functions, higher-order functions, lambdas, and
in many ways also favors composition over inheritance.
